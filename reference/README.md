# Reference Materials

This directory contains PDF reference files for the RPG game project.

## Suggested Organization

You can organize PDFs into subdirectories such as:
- `rules/` - Game rules and mechanics
- `lore/` - World-building and story documents
- `characters/` - Character sheets and templates
- `maps/` - Map references and layouts
- `assets/` - Art and design references

Feel free to organize the PDFs in whatever way works best for your project.
